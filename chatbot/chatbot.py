This will help to prevent infection.\n* **Rinse the wound.** Rinse the wound with clean water. You can use a faucet or a bottle of water.\n* **Apply soap.** Apply soap to the wound and gently scrub it. Be careful not to scrub too hard, as this can damage the skin.\n* **Rinse the wound again.** Rinse the wound with clean water to remove the soap.\n* **Apply an antibiotic ointment.** Applying an antibiotic ointment can help to prevent infection.\n* **Cover the wound with a bandage.** Covering the wound will help to protect it from dirt and germs."
