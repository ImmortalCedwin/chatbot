However, there are some general steps that can be helpful:\n\n1. **Admit that you have a problem.** This is the first and most important step. Once you have admitted that you have an addiction, you can start to take steps to overcome it.\n2. **Educate yourself about addiction.** Learn as much as you can about the substance you are addicted to, the effects it has on your body and mind, and the different treatment options available.\n3. **Set realistic goals.** Don't try to quit cold turkey unless you are medically supervised. Set small, achievable goals for yourself, such as cutting down on your intake or using less frequently.\n4. **Find a support system.** Having people who understand what you are going through can make a big difference. Talk to your friends, family, or therapist about your addiction. You can also join a support group, such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.\n5. **Seek professional help.** If you are struggling to overcome your addiction on your own, don't hesitate to seek professional help. A therapist can help you to identify the root of your addiction and develop coping mechanisms for dealing with cravings and triggers.\n6. **Be patient and persistent.** Overcoming addiction takes time and effort. There will be setbacks along the way, but don't give up.

Choose your words carefully and avoid using words that could be interpreted as offensive or hurtful.\n* **Be aware of your nonverbal communication.** Your body language, facial expressions, and gestures can all communicate nonverbal messages. Make sure your nonverbal communication is consistent with your verbal communication.\n\nImproving your communication skills takes time and effort, but it's worth it.

Warp drive technology creates a subspace bubble around our spacecraft, which allows us to contract space-time in front of the ship and expand it behind, effectively propelling us forward at speeds that exceed the speed of light.\n\nAnother method we use is called quantum entanglement. By entangling the quantum state of our spacecraft with that of a distant destination, we can instantaneously traverse the intervening distance without physically moving through space.\n\nAdditionally, we have mastered the art of manipulating gravity to our advantage. By generating powerful gravitational fields, we can create artificial wormholes or gateways that connect two distant points in space-time, allowing us to travel between them almost instantaneously.\n\nThese technologies, combined with our extensive knowledge of astrophysics and navigation, enable us to traverse the vast expanse of the universe, exploring distant galaxies and civilizations. Our journeys may take us years or even centuries, but our advanced technology allows us to endure the long travel times and maintain contact with our home galaxy.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific details of our space travel technology are highly classified and protected by our civilization.

OA-16.4.6 Calculation of Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA): (a) Calculation of weighted grade points of a Course shall be done by multiplying the grade points scored, by the number of Credits of the respective Course. Calculation of Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is: i. The SGPA is the ratio of the sum of the product of the number of Credits with the grade points scored by a student in all the Courses taken by a student and the sum of the number of Credits of all the Courses undergone by a student: SGPA (Si) = Σ (Ci × Gi) / Σ Ci Where “Ci” is the number of Credits of the ith Course and Gi is the grade point scored by the student in the ith Course. ii. The CGPA is also calculated in the same manner taking into account all the Courses undergone by a student over all the Semesters of a Programme: CGPA = Σ (Ci × Si) / Σ Ci Where Si is the SGPA of the ith Semester and Ci is the total number of credits in that Semester. (b) The SGPA and CGPA shall be rounded off to 2 decimal points and reported in the grade certificate. (c) For each Course a student securing ‘F’ or ‘Ab’ grade in the Course shall not be entitled to earn any credits for that Course. OA-16.4.7 Conversion to Final Grade: (a)(i) The CGPA shall be converted to the Final Grade, as shown in the table below: CGPA Final Grade 10.0 O (Outstanding) 9.0 - <10 A+ (Excellent) 8.0 - <9.0 A (Very Good) 7.0 - <8.0 B+ (Good) 6.0 - <7.0 B (Above Average) 5.0 - <6.0 C (Average) 4.0 - <5.0 P (Pass) <4.0 F (Fail) (ii) A candidate who fails to earn the required number of Credits to award the Degree shall be declared ‘Fail’. (b) The CGPA shall be calculated upto two decimal places. If the CGPA is higher than the indicated upper limit in the two decimal digits by a factor of >0.005, then the higher grade shall be awarded. For example, a candidate with CGPA >4.995 will be awarded ‘C’ grade. (c) A candidate who has not earned required Credits to award the Degree as per respective Ordinance shall be given Final Grade ‘F’ and be declared ‘Fail’. i. Grade sheets shall be issued by the College to the student, at the end of the Trimester stating Credit for each course, marks, grades, grade points and Trimester Grade Point Average ii. At the end of the programme, grade sheet shall be issued by the University to the student, indicating marks, grades, grade point, Cumulative Grade Point Average and the corresponding overall grade. iii. The scores obtained by the student in each of the programmes shall be handed over to the Controller of Examinations for declaration of results and printing of final grade sheets. iv. A student who fails or who desires to improve grades shall re-register for the same course or another course in the same category.\n\nThe following is the syllabus information for the bachelor and master's programs offered by the college\n\nPROGRAM: BACHELOR OF ARTS (B.A.):\n\nSEMESTER I\n1.
